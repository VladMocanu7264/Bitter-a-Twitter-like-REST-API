# Bitter-a-Twitter-like-REST-API
This is my final project as participant in the 2023 edition of FiiPractic.

This is a REST API that sets up a few simple HTTP requests.

It uses Java accompanied by the SpringBoot framework and the Maven library.

To see a usage example you can check out my showcase video or try it yourself, using  this Postman collection:
